What is you site's primary purpose?

Primary purposes of this site are to assist as well as document my learning of Web Development.

Who is your target audience?

Cohort members and teachers at EDA are the main target audience for this site.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

An organised and somewhat linear reading of information is appropriate for this site as it grows in content. Content is mostly text-based, so appropriate text layout and design will is necessary.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Updating often and implementing and testing new design features as they are learnt will gradually build the site to fit a desired user experience â€” what these best features are specifically I am yet unsure of.
